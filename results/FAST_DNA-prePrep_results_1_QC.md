# Samples

* 15.11.2018
* used the [metagenome]FAST-DNA-prePrep.md protocol
* used the "best" DNA approach, and changed initial sludge handling
  * 0.4 ml initial sludge
  * one additional humic acid removal wash step
  * 6 m/s 20s
* used reactor G1 and GR2 in mixture

> GR1 and 2 originate from Uppsala Co-digestion plant and are fed a mixture of household waste and slaughterhouse waste. These reactors operate at mesophilic temperature (37C) and at high nitrogen levels (approx. 8-10 g/L).

# Conclusion

1. removing the supernatant first and replacing it with water or **alternatively with Sodium Phosphat buffer** seems to be the best approach DNA quality wise.
2. DNase and Proteinase K treatment initial seems to be at most risky (see sample band number 4)
