# Samples

* 24.10.2018
* used the [metagenome]FAST-DNA-AmpBeads.md protocol
* used reactor G1 and GR2 in mixture
> GR1 and 2 originate from Uppsala Co-digestion plant and are fed a mixture of household waste and slaughterhouse waste. These reactors operate at mesophilic temperature (37C) and at high nitrogen levels (approx. 8-10 g/L).

| ID | sludge [ml] | humic wash |  amount [ng/µl] | after beads (+) [ng/µl]
| -| -------- | ---| ---|----|
| **1.h1.b** | 0.2 | yes | 552 | 380

*b means additional bead purification; h1 means additional humic acid removal step;* (+) volume decreased now to 50 µl total

1. Adding more sludge decreases total yield
2. The humic acid removal wash step has no significant impact on the total yield

## DNA gel

* 2 µl sample; 6 µl H2O; 2 µl dye
* 5 µl marker
* 1k marker (from top to down 20kb 10kb 7kb **5kb**)

*Marker, 1 - 8, Marker*

* 0.4 ml sludge produces the best bands in the upper DNA length. maybe the increased amount of sludge "buffers" the bead impact leading to less fragmentation?
*

open questions:
1. does these steps have impact on the DNA fragment length?
