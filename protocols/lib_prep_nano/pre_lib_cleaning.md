Pre cleaning step for DNA
===
+ **comparing yield and QC:** [**click here**](QC/pre_lib_cleaning_results.md)

* add **60 µl DNA** sample to **30 µl H2O** (vary this depending on concentration)
  * this was used for around 500 ng/µl which was reduced to around 250 ng/µl
  * alternatively take **70 µl DNA + 20 µl H2O** if c(DNA) is below 250 ng/µl
* add **45 µl magnetic Beads** (0.5 Volume, e.g. AMPure, HighPrep) and shake a bit
  * less bead volume may improve the results (e.g. 0.3-0.4 Volume)
* incubate for **10 min at RT**
* spin down
* **bind to magnet** until clear and remove supernatant
* (wash 1/2) add 150 µl Ethanol (80 %), don't disturb pellet
* (wash 1/2) remove supernatant
* (wash 2/2) add 150 µl Ethanol (80 %), don't disturb pellet
* (wash 2/2) remove supernatant
* **remove from magnet** spin down, bind on magnet and remove residual liquid **with 10 µl pipette**
* add 30 µl H2O, resuspend via flicking
* incubate for 10 min at RT
* spin down and put on magnetic
* retrieve the liquid with the DNA


* determine Concentration via Qubit and DNA Size via Gel or Agilent
