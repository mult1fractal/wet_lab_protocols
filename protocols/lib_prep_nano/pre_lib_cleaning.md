Pre cleaning step for DNA
===
+ **comparing yield and QC:** [**click here**](QC/pre_lib_cleaning_results.md)

* add 30 µl DNA sample to 60 µl H2O (vary this depending on concentration)
  * this was used for around 500 ng/µl which was reduced to around 250 ng/µl
* add 0.5 µl magnetic Beads (e.g. AMPure)
* incubate for 10 min at RT
* spin down
* bind on magnetic until clear and remove supernatant
* (wash 1/2) add 150 µl Ethanol (80 %), don't disturb pellet
* (wash 1/2) remove supernatant
* (wash 2/2) add 150 µl Ethanol (80 %), don't disturb pellet
* (wash 2/2) remove supernatant
* spin down, bind on magnet and remove residual liquid
* add 30 µl H2O, resuspend via flicking
* incubate for 10 min at RT
* spin down and put on magnetic
* retrieve the liquid with the DNA
