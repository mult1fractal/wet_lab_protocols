___
# General

+ [This is the FastDNA Kit](https://www.mpbio.com/product.php?pid=116540600&country=223)
+ protocol is based on the best results from:
  * [FAST-DNA]([metagenome]FAST-DNA.md)
  * [FAST-DNA AmpBeads]([metagenome]FAST-DNA-AmpBeads.md)
  * [FAST DNA BeadBeating]([metagenome]FAST-DNA-BeadBeating.md)
  * [FAST DNA prePrep]([metagenome]FAST-DNA-prePrep.md)
+ yield should be around 400 - 500 ng/µl
+ DNA should "smear" around 10.000 - 20.000 bp; [see results]([metagenome]FAST-DNA-prePrep.md)

# Protocol

* [ ] RNase A ready
* [ ] humic acid wash solution ready


0. add **400 µl** of homogenic sludge/cells sample via 1 ml syringe to a 2 ml tube
1. **centrifuge (5 min 20,000g)**, remove supernatant, **replace with same volume of H2O**
2. **Transfer sample** to Lysing Matrix E tube and add **778 µl Sodium Phosphate Buffer**
3. Add **122 µL MT Buffer**
4. Homogenize via FastPrep®-24 Classic I. for **20 s** at **6 m/s**, put on ice after
5. Centrifuge at **14,000g** for **15 min**, **4 °C**
6. Transfer supernatant to a **clean 2 ml tube**
7. add **1 µl of RNase A** to each sample, incubate for 5 min
8. Add **250 µl PPS** (Protein precipitation solution) and mix carefully but efficiently by inverting at least 10 times
9. centrifuge **14,000 g** for **10 min** at **4 °C** to pellet
10. Transfer supernatant to clean **5 ml tube**
11. **Resuspend Binding Matrix suspension** and **add 1 ml to 5 ml tube**
12. invert by hand for 2 min to allow DNA binding (avoid "matrix pellet" here). Place on a rack for **30-60 min** to allow settling of matrix

> Prepare HA-wash solution:  
>> 12(+1) uses :
>> 4.564 ml Sodium Phosphate Buffer
>>
>> 0.568 ml MT Buffer
>>
>> 1.166 ml PPS
>>
> * mix at full speed for 2 min
> * add 6.3 ml 5.5 M Guanidine Thiocyanat and mix


13. Discard **650 µl of supernatant** without disturbing the binding matrix
14. Gently resuspend Binding Matrix in the remaining amount of supernatant via inverting. **Transfer ~ 600 µl of the Mixture to a Spin Filter** and centrifuge at **14,000g for 1 min**. Empty the catch tube and add the remaining mixture to the spin filter and centrifuge as before. Empty the catch tube again
15. add **500 µl of HA-wash solution** and gently resuspend the pellet using a pipet tip, centrifuge for **14,000 g for 1 min**, empty catch tube
16. add **500 µl SEWS-M** and gently resuspend the pellet using a pipet tip, centrifuge for **1 min at 14,000 g**, **replace** the catch tube
17. Centrifuge a second time at **14,000 g for 2 min** to dry the membrane. Discard the catch tube and add a **new clean 1.5 ml** tube
18. Air dry the Spin-Filter for **5 min at RT**
19. **Add 70 µl 55 °C DES** to the spin filter and gently **stir via pipette the Binding Matrix a bit**, incubate for at least **5 min**
20. Centrifuge at **14,000 g for 1 min** to get the eluate
21. Store at 4 °C
