* F. candida animals (“Berlin strain”, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) were kept at 15 °C in a climate room.
* For high molecular DNA isolation, we crushed 16 times 100 animals with CTAB lysis buffer (800 μl per 100 animals) and incubated the lysates for 2 h at 65 °C.
* We extracted DNA from the lysates with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1).
* After this step, we pooled the water phases into 4 samples and precipitated the DNA with isopropanol.
* The pellets were dried and solved in 400 μl H2O. To each aliquot, we added 1 μl RNAse (100 mg/ml) and after an incubation of 15 min at 37 °C, we purified the DNA again with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.
* We precipitated the DNA with (3 x volume) ethanol 100% and (1/10 x volume) NaAc (3 M, pH = 5.2), washed the pellets with ethanol 70% and after drying we solved the DNA in 200 μl H2O.
* An extra cleanup of the DNA was necessary for downstream procedures.
* Therefore, we used the MoBio Power Clean® DNA clean up kit and followed the manufacturer’s protocol.
* F. candida genome fragments of more than 20 kbp were sequenced using 12 SMRT cells on the PacBio RS II platform (with P6 chemistry) according to the manufacturer’s protocol at the Leiden Genome Technology Center (LGTC).

* The cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is used to liberate and complex with total cellular nucleic acids. CTAB forms an insoluble complex with nucleic acids when the initial NaCl concentration is lowered to ~0.5 M. Polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and other enzyme-inhibiting contaminats found in plant cells are efficiently removed in the supernatant because most do not precipitate under these conditions (1).

* sludge preparation, median is around 4000 bp

DNA  from  biogas  plants  1–7  was  extracted  using  the
ZR  Fecal  DNA  MiniPrep™ Kit  (Zymo  Research;  Irvine, USA).  Cell  lysis  was  performed  with  a  high-speed  cell
disturber Precellys® 24 Homogenisator (VWR, Germany)
for  40  s  at  5000  rpm.  Additional  cleanup  of  the  isolated
DNA  was  performed  by  Agencourt  AMRure  XP  beads
from  Beckman  Coulter  (Brea,  CA,  USA).  Isolated  DNA
was stored at −20 °C until library preparation. RNA was
isolated  using  the  ZR  Soil/Fecal  RNA  MicroPrep
™Kit  (Zymo  Research,  Irvine,  USA).  Isolated  RNA  was  stored
at
−80  °C  until  further  preparation  steps.  The  qualities
of  nucleic  acids  were  checked  with  the  HS  NGS  and  HS
RNA  Fragment  Analysis  Kit  on  a  Fragment  Analyzer
(AATI, USA).
Nucleic  acids  from  R1  and  R2  samples  were  isolated
according to a protocol published recently
